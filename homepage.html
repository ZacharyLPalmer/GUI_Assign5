            <h3>Welcome to my homepage for Graphical User Interface 1!</h3>

            <p>
                My name is Zachary Palmer and I am a
                senior computer science student
                here at UMASS Lowell.
            </p>

            <p>On this page you will find some background information on myself as well as some
                analysis of my time here at University of Massachussets Lowell.
                This is my fantastic homepage created for assignment 2 of GUI 1!
            </p>

            <h2>A little about myself</h2>

            <p>I have a passion for coding, cars, and coffee. Over the course of my college career I have owned
                a two different 2016 mustangs; all bought and paid for by working through college.
            </p>

                <figcaption>My original mustang - a ecoboost automatic</figcaption>
            </figure>

                <figcaption>My current car - a beautiful stick shift Mustang GT</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>A little about my time here at UML</h2>

            <p>I transferred into UML from a small private univeristy in South Carolina called Bob Jones Univerisity
                after my freshman year.
            </p>

            <p>The table below lists the computer science classes I have taken so far, when I took them and the
                accompanying grade I received.
                It is clearly evident that after I adjusted during my first two semesters my grades improved
                significantly.
